## Alternative setup - Create structure with bash script
Important note -  this setup will only create the directories and files and does not contain any css content
- First create your desired directory: `mkdir scss`
- Make sure you're in the `scss` directory: `cd scss`
- Make it executable first by running the command: `chmod +x setup-itcss.sh`
- Run the script: `bash setup-itcss.sh`
